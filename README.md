# What the application does
AmazonWish provides an interactive shopping simulation where users can experience a real-life shopping environment before making actual purchases.

Users receive virtual currency to explore and shop within the simulated app, tailored to their real shopping preferences.
They can rate and provide feedback on their experience, helping refine AI-driven personalization.
The app is compatible with VR devices for an immersive experience, but also supports Bitmoji avatars for users without VR access.
When satisfied with their virtual shopping experience, users can seamlessly transition to the real shopping platform to complete their purchases.
By bridging AI-powered ad personalization with an engaging virtual shopping experience, AmazonWish reduces return rates, ad waste, and consumer frustration while promoting smarter, more sustainable online shopping.
